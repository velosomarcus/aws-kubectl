This project was forked from https://github.com/Odania-IT/aws-kubectl and you can see the Setup instructions on that site.

The goal is to create multi-arch images for the AWS-KUBECTL using Docker BuildX CLI plugin.

The Docker Images contains the aws-cli and kubectl. It is used to update the AWS ECR credentials periodically in a kubernetes cluster.

The Docker images created by these files are available for download on Docker Hub:

This is based on the work of @Odania-IT and @xynova.
